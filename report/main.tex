% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.

% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.

\begin{abstract}
We developed an application for mobile devices that uses an efficient HRTF model based on to create 3D soundscapes. The HRTF model is based on a combination of filters and delays provided on theoretical basis by Brown et. al. [1]. The device orientation is used to set the angle between the sound and the user. This model has many possibilities on the limited hardware capabilities of the mobile devices in comparison to HRTF database based models. The prototype will present the user several sounds scattered in a limited area where the user can interact with

\section{Introduction}
A lot of research on modelling 3-D sound has been done with fairly good solutions (references). The best results can be obtained by those models implementing 3-D sound using personalized HRTF functions which needs tedious measuring of impulseresponses etc (reference). Since mobile applications as well as multimedia productions are usually aimed at a big number of users, implementing personalized HRTF functions would require measurements of the individual user which is almost impossible. Additionally, using huge databases with HRTF's for subjects having similar head diameters and pinnae structures (dunno, how those HRTF's work) are not feasible for mobile applications as memory space is limited. Therefore, the aim of this project was to develop an computationally efficient and general HRTF model, yet, keeping the quality of the 3-D sound as good as possible. We therefore used the model provided on a theoretical basis in \cite{Brown1998} by implementing a combination of filters and delays in pure data and C. This audio engine was then embedded in a mobile application. Sensor data provided by the phone or tablet was used to compute from which direction the sound should appear to be coming from. With the application users should be able to discover a virtual sound space situated in Copenhagen. This means that our HRTF model should satisfy two major requirements. 
\\1. It should provide direction cues that are good enough to guide the user to the position where a specific sound is situated. 
\\2. It should give the user a feeling of how far the sound is away from the users current location. 

\\The first aim of course is bound to accuracy of the GPS signal and orientation data provided by the individual mobile phone. We hypothized that using a general HRTF model should be of sufficient quality to satisfy the first requirement since sensory data can be rather noisy anyways which would be overfitted by a very precise HRTF model.

\\The second hypothesis was that providing some interaction (button press on sound, then distance cues slides from farthest to current location etc.) could habituate the user to be able after some training to approximate the distance of the sound from the users current location.

Taken both hypothesises together the user should experience a soundscape in at least 2-dimensions, azimuth and distance.

First, some state of the art research on 3-D sound will be provided. That section will be followed by the presentation of our implementation of the audio engine as well as the main application. In the last part we will present the results obtained by testing our application and discuss those in light of the two hypothesises stated above.

\subsection{Human sound localization}
	

\textit{also some argumentation why we used a HRTF model based on filtering rather than using a database (citations why database not efficient and why quality better with databases but good enough with filtering)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{The application}
We decided to develop our application for android. Nevertheless, we did not use the API provided by Android Studio but instead used openFrameworks which is a ...... (reference). The reasons why we decided to develop using this programming environment was the need of a fast communication between the mobile device and our programm code. Since programming in C can be directly translated into machine code and does not need to be interpreted by a virtual machine as it is the case for java (reference) we hoped to increase the speed of our application to fulfill the needs of a realtime application. Additionally openFrameworks as open source project provides a multitude of addons enabling us to benefit from already solved problems. (include a list of addons we used maybe). As last but rather minor point as far as our motivation for this application was concerned it should be mentioned that programming independent from a specific API such as those provided for Android or iOS makes modifying our application to run on a different operating system easier as the main code is written platform independent.

\subsection{Sensory data extraction}
Our application required two main sensory information. We needed the GPS location of the user to calculate the distance to the sounds that were placed on fixed GPS locations in addition to the angle the user is heading relative to the sound sources. To access the GPS data we used an already existing addon called ?ofxMaps and ofxGeo? (reference to webpage/gitrepository). (Something about smoothing if we used it, and maybe we have to look into the code how they used smoothing). To calculate the angle between the heading of the user and the sound source we had to extract the bearing between our location and the location of the sound (reference and some explanation about bearing maybe?) as well as the heading of our mobile phone relative to the magnetic south (geographic north pole). The bearing could be accessed via the ofxGeo addon. In order to access the compass orientation we built our own addon accessing the 'SENSOR TYPE ORIENTATION' provided by the android API. Having this information we now had to differentiate between four cases: (some images and explenation about how we calculatet the angle between our heading orientation and the sound). In order to smooth the sensory data (especially for the orientation) we filtered the sensory information by computing the median of a chunk of mediansize instances of the sensor output. 

\subsection{Audio engine}
The audio engine was the most crucial part of our applications. As shortly mentioned in the introduction (and/or state of the art in 3-D sound) we decided to use a filter based HRTF model which claimed to be both 'efficient' and of reasonable 'quality' \cite{Brown1997} in order to achieve a satisfying user experience and an efficient real time application. We basicly followed the workflow (order of filter and delay lines) given in \cite{Brown1997} and depicted in figure ... . 

First the sound had to be split up in ....
Second .....
Third IID and ITD
 We therefore used the analog filter models provided in \cite{Brown1997} and further specified in \cite{Brown1998}. The head shadow filter, implementing the ILD, was given by the following analog transfer function:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:analog}
H\left( s,\theta\right) = \frac{\alpha (\theta)s+\beta}{s+\beta},\: where\:\beta = \frac{2c}{a}
\end{equation}
Since this is an analog transfer function we had to derive the digital version by applying a bilinear transform applying the following substitution:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bilin}
s = \frac{2}{T} \frac{z-1}{z+1},\: where\:T\:is\:???
\end{equation}
Applying the substitutin in Equation~\ref{eq:bilin} to Equation~\ref{eq:analog} we get the following filter function in the digital domain:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:filter}
H\left( z,\theta\right) = \frac{\alpha (\theta)(\frac{2}{T} \frac{z-1}{z+1})+\beta}{(\frac{2}{T} \frac{z-1}{z+1})+\beta}
\end{equation}
To identify the filter coefficients we transformed Equation ~\ref{eq:filter} and obtained the following frequency response\footnote{For the derivation of Equation~\ref{eq:filterparam} see appendix A}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:filterparam}
H\left( z,\theta\right) = \frac{2\alpha (\theta)+T\beta+z^{-1}(-2\alpha(\theta)+T\beta)}{2+T\beta+z^{-1}(-2+T\beta)} = \frac{Y(z)}{X(z)}
\end{equation} 
This gives us the filter coefficients $a_0 = 2\alpha (\theta)+T\beta$ and $a_1 = -2\alpha(\theta)+T\beta$ as well as $b_0 = 2+T\beta$ and $b_1 = -2+T\beta$. Since we could not use the filter function in Matlab which has as input values the filter coefficientes we had to isolate the output $Y(z)$ in Equation~\ref{eq:filterparam} as well as going from the frequency to the time domain. The result is given in Equation~\ref{eq:out}\footnote{For the derivation of Equation~\ref{eq:out} see appendix B}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:out}
Y[n] =\frac{a_0X[n]+a_1X[n-1]-b_1Y[n-1]}{b_0}
\end{equation}
