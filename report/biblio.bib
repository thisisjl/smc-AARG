@article{Norman2010,
abstract = {Reviewers of research reports frequently criticize the choice of statistical methods. While some of these criticisms are well-founded, frequently the use of various parametric methods such as analysis of variance, regression, correlation are faulted because: (a) the sample size is too small, (b) the data may not be normally distributed, or (c) The data are from Likert scales, which are ordinal, so parametric statistics cannot be used. In this paper, I dissect these arguments, and show that many studies, dating back to the 1930s consistently show that parametric statistics are robust with respect to violations of these assumptions. Hence, challenges like those above are unfounded, and parametric methods can be utilized without concern for "getting the wrong answer".},

@article{Kuzon1996,
abstract = {In a pedantic but playful way, we discuss some common errors in the use of 'statistical analysis' that are regularly observed in our professional plastic surgical literature. The seven errors we discuss are (1) the use of parametric analysis of ordinal data; (2) the inappropriate use of parametric analysis in general; (3) the failure to consider the possibility of committing type II statistical error; (4) the use of unmodified t-tests for multiple comparisons; (5) the failure to employ analysis of covariance, multivariate regression, nonlinear regression, and logistical regression when indicated; (6) the habit of reporting standard error instead of standard deviation; and (7) the underuse or overuse of statistical consultation. Confidence and common sense are advocated as a means to balance statistical significance with clinical importance.},
